- AI code has emitted LowStockWarning event type during product creation only. This needs to be emitted during product update also
- Notification panel was subscribed to low_stock_alert instead of LowStockWarning which does not mactch with emited event type from the backend. Fixed it
- Manually verified and updated minio accessId and accessKey
- seperate the code into two functions (to follow single responsibility concept) 
    - writing to Dynamo db functionality 
    - saving old events to S3 functionality 
- create the dynamo db table before writing if the table does not exist
