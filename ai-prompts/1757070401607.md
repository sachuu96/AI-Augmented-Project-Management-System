Explain the event work flow in detail according to the below given spec
1. API writes product changes.
2. Event emitted using kafka.
3. Consumers:
Notifications service → pushes UI notifications (fan-out to SSE/WebSocket publisher).
Analytics service → updates stats store.
4. UI listens (SSE/WebSocket) → updates notifications panel and, optionally, refetches products.

Yes — let’s walk through the **event-driven flow** step by step, in the context of the product management system you’re building.

## 🔄 Event Workflow (Expanded)

### 1. **API writes product changes**

* A seller calls the REST API (`POST /products`, `PUT /products/:id`, or `DELETE /products/:id`).
* The request is scoped by `X-Seller-Id`, so each seller only manipulates their own products.
* The API writes to the **products table** in Postgres.

---

### 2. **Event emitted**

* After a successful DB write, the backend emits an event to the **event bus** (SQS in our design).
* Event types:

  * `ProductCreated`
  * `ProductUpdated`
  * `ProductDeleted`
  * `LowStockWarning` (emitted if `quantity < LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD` after an update).

---

### 3. **Consumers process events**

The event bus (kafka) decouples producers (API) from consumers. Multiple consumers can subscribe:

* **Notifications service**

  * Listens to kafka messages.
  * Pushes events to connected UI clients via SSE.
  * Example: if `quantity` drops below threshold, a **LowStockWarning** event is immediately streamed to the seller’s dashboard.

* **Analytics service**

  * Another consumer of the same events.
  * Updates aggregated stats (e.g., number of products per category, low-stock counts).
  * Could run in a background worker.

---

### 4. **UI listens & updates**

* The React SPA opens an SSE connection:
  `GET /events/stream?sellerId=seller-demo`
* Server holds open the connection (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`).
* When the Notifications service pushes a new event:

  * The server writes it into the SSE stream:

    ```
    event: ProductUpdated
    data: {"productId": "123", "quantity": 2}
    ```
* The browser receives it:

  * Updates the notifications panel (e.g., “⚠️ Product X low on stock”).
  * Optionally triggers a **refetch** of `/products` to refresh the table.

---

## 🗄️ Database & Event Storage

* **Products DB** (OLTP layer)

  * Stores current state of products.
  * Example (Postgres):

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE products (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      seller_id TEXT NOT NULL,
      name TEXT,
      description TEXT,
      price NUMERIC,
      quantity INT,
      category TEXT,
      UNIQUE(seller_id, id)
    );
    CREATE INDEX idx_products_seller_id ON products(seller_id);
    ```
  * Indexing: `(seller_id, product_id)` ensures fast lookups per seller.

* **Event Log**

  * **Recent events** → stored in **DynamoDB** for quick lookups and replay.

    * Partition key: `sellerId`
    * Sort key: `timestamp#eventId`
    * This makes it easy to query all events for a given seller, in order.
  * **Historical events** → offloaded to **S3**.

    * Stored as JSON files (e.g., `2025-09-05/ProductUpdated/123.json`).
    * Cheap storage, still queryable with Athena or similar tools.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Write product → emit event → event bus → fan-out to consumers.
* Notifications → SSE to UI.
* Analytics → stats/BI pipelines.
* Storage strategy: products in Postgres, event log recent in DynamoDB, history in S3.
