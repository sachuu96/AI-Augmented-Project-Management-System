prompt - I am building a product management system using Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL with an event-driven architecture. I want to generate a scaffolded, modular application that supports CRUD operations for products, CSV import/export, SSE notifications, and event publishing (Kafka/SNS/SQS/EventBridge). Include clustering and worker threads. Letâ€™s break it down into smaller prompts for iterative development. 

First create a PostgreSQL products table based on the OpenAPI schema given below. Include a trigger to auto-update updatedAt. Also, provide a Node.js db.ts module using pg to connect to the database and execute queries.

please consider below openAPI definition as the contract
