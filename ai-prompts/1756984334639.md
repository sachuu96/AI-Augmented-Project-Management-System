Iâ€™m building a Product Management API for a React dashboard backed by PostgreSQL.
The backend does CRUD operations on products, and each operation emits a domain event published to Kafka. Products have fields: id , sellerId, name, description, price, quantity, category. Include CRUD endpoints with request/response schemas. 

Please generate a complete OpenAPI 3.0.3 YAML specification that includes:

Endpoints for:
- GET /products: list all products for the seller.
- POST /products: create a product (emits ProductCreated).
- PUT /products/{id}: update a product (emits ProductUpdated, and possibly LowStockWarning).
- DELETE /products/{id}: delete a product (emits ProductDeleted).
- A Server-Sent Events endpoint at /events/stream that pushes LowStockWarning events.

Schemas for:
- Product (with id, sellerId, name, description, price, quantity, category, timestamps).
- All the properties are required except for description.
- CreateProductInput (subset of Product).

Error response.

- Event schemas (ProductCreated, ProductUpdated, ProductDeleted, LowStockWarning) following event-driven architecture patterns, with fields like   type, version, occurredAt, sellerId, etc.

- Each seller should only access their own products, so include an X-Seller-Id header in all requests (simulated auth).

Make the YAML concise but standards-compliant, with examples where useful.
