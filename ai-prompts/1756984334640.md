prompt - I have a react dashboard to do crud operation to products saved in a postgresql database. When I do crud operations via REST api calls, server publishes events to kafka topic. There are two consumers listening to those topics notification service and analysis worker. Notification service consumes those events and send server send events (SSE) to client side via /events/streams endpoint and analysis worker consumes them and save to a dynamo database as well as archived events to s3. <openAPI.yml file> consider my openAPI.yml and draw a simple architecture diagram for a React dashboard using WebSocket for low-stock notifications, calling a REST API backend specified in openAPI.yml.

response - 

Perfect! Let’s visualize a **simple architecture diagram** based on your `openapi.yml`. Since your OpenAPI specifies a REST API backend and an **SSE endpoint for low-stock alerts**, we can represent the components clearly: frontend, backend, and event flow.

Here’s a textual diagram for clarity first:


**Explanation of Components and Flow:**

1. **React Dashboard (SPA)**

   * Contains **Products Table**, **Product Modal**, **Notifications Panel**.
   * Calls REST API for listing, creating, updating, deleting products.
   * Opens modal prefilled for edit, shows toast notifications for success/failure.

2. **Backend API Server**

   * Implements all endpoints in your OpenAPI:

     * `/products` (GET/POST)
     * `/products/{id}` (PUT/DELETE)
   * Emits **Server-Sent Events** (`/events/stream`) when low-stock alerts occur.

3. **Database**

   * Stores product data, with fields matching your `Product` schema (`id, sellerId, name, price, quantity, category, etc.`).

4. **Notifications Panel**

   * Subscribes to SSE events from `/events/stream`.
   * Displays real-time low-stock alerts.
   * React component listens and updates UI automatically.

If you want, I can also **draw a polished visual diagram** in an image format that you can directly include in your repo or documentation.

Do you want me to do that next?
