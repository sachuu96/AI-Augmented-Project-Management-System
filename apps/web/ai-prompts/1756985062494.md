You are my coding assistant. I am building a minimal React single-page dashboard based on the following requirements:

- Uses Vite + React + TypeScript.
- Minimal styling (no component libraries).
- Page: Products Dashboard
  - Table of products: name, price, quantity, category, actions (edit, delete).
  - "Add product" button → opens modal.
  - "Edit" action → opens same modal prefilled.
  - "Delete" action → confirmation → calls API.
- Modal (create/edit product)
  - Fields: name, description, price, quantity, category.
  - Save → calls API and closes modal.
  - On create/update success → show toast and refresh table.
  - If quantity < threshold after save → surface low-stock alert in Notifications Panel.
- Notifications Panel (right rail or footer)
  - Shows low-stock alerts in near-real-time (SSE/WebSocket to `/events/stream`).
- API endpoints are defined in this OpenAPI spec: [paste OpenAPI YAML here]

**Tasks:**
1. Generate React component scaffolds:
   - `Dashboard.tsx` (main page)
   - `ProductTable.tsx` (table with actions)
   - `ProductModal.tsx` (form modal)
   - `NotificationsPanel.tsx` (real-time low-stock alerts)
2. Generate `api/products.ts` functions based on the OpenAPI spec.
3. Show example state management approach (React hooks) for:
   - Fetching products
   - Opening/closing modal
   - Handling create/update/delete flows
   - Listening to events/stream events for low stock
4. Generate minimal Jest + React Testing Library test examples for:
   - Adding a product
   - Editing a product
   - Low-stock alert rendering
5. Ensure code is barebones and focused on clarity, not UI polish.
6. Comment on what parts I (the human) should validate or adjust.

Please output the code in a well-structured format with filenames, so I can copy directly into my project.
