Implement event publishing for ProductCreated, ProductUpdated, ProductDeleted, and LowStockWarning using Kafka 
Include a modular events/publisher.ts and make CRUD operations trigger events asynchronously. Support worker threads to handle event dispatching. Follow below given schema for events

<shared contract for events from openapi.yml>


What I accepted
----------------
- worker thread invocation is wrapped inside publishEvent function - following decorator pattern which I accepted


what I /modified
-----------------

- Above prompt scaffold a code which had below behavior

    - When I call publishEvent("ProductCreated", payload) in through product controller, it spawns a Worker pointing at worker.ts passing the event This approach, isolates each call in its own worker thread. That worker thread does only one thing: connect -> publish event -> disconnect -> exit
    - This made to create a worker thread per event which was not the most efficient way to go about
    - It was creating kafka producer per thread also
    - I re-iterated with AI tool to created a dedicated worker thread to handle event publishing task and use singleton producer object with out creating multiple per event


- AI code has emitted LowStockWarning event type during product creation only. This needs to be emitted during product update also

- worker.ts file connects to kafka producer and producer publishes the message with topic and payload. Then worker thread sends {success:true} object to the main thread. But in publisher.ts value of success key was not checked. Fixed it (if true - resolves. if false - rejects)
